create a peekable iterator out of tokens

suppose the final_value is null at the start

while (there is some `token` in tokens iterator){
	match (token.kind){
		`{` => parse_object(token)
	}
}





{
	"user": {
		"name": "some_name",
		"age": "some_age"
	},
	"roll_number": "some_number",
	"links": [1,2,3,4]
}

--- above will be tokenized as follows ---

{
"user" 		
:
{
"name"
:
"some_name"
,
"age"
:
"some_age"
}
,
"roll_number"
:
"some_number"
,
"links"
:
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]
}
